            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, bring 3 cups of salted water to a boil. Add carrots and cook for about 1 minute or until half done. 
                With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge into bowl of ice bath. </li>
            <li>Add broccoli and cauliflower to the boiling water and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until half-done.

            <li>Reserve 2 cups of the poaching liquid (the one used to blanch vegetables).</li>
            <li>Drain vegetables from the ice bath when they are cold.</li>
            <li>In a wok or wide skillet over medium heat, heat about 2 tablespoons of the oil.</li>

            <li>Discard excess oil and wipe down the pan. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and heat.</li>
            <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>

            <li>Add the liver and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add parboiled vegetables, baby corn, and quail eggs, stirring gently to combine, and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
